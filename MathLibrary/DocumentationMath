**Name:** Math Library

**Problem Statement:**  
Need to have simmple math or math fucntions that can be easily called on for later use. 

**Problem Specifications:**   
* Need to have Simple math for later use   
* Need to have functions that are usniversally used that can be called   

 # II.Design  

 *1.System Architecture*   
 All objects can be used to create 2d, 3d or velocity. They each are responisble for soliving or holding math function and simple math. As well as housing thing such as rotation, translation, and scale.
